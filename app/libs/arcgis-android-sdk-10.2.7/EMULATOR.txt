Setting up the Android Emulator

10.2.6-2

----------------------------
Overview
----------------------------
The Android SDK provides a virtual mobile device emulator that you can prototype, test, and develop Android applications without the need for a physical device.

The Android tools team introduced OpenGL support in Android 4.0.3r2.  This has allowed us to support the emulator in the ArcGIS Runtime SDK for Android.

----------------------------
Virtual Machine Acceleration
----------------------------
The Android emulator allows for taking advantage of a CPU extension for running virtual machines (VM's).  In order to take advantage of this feature you must make use of x86 system image target emulator.  We provide x86 native libs to support running an emulator inside an accelerated virtual machine.

----------------------------
Additional Configuration for VM Acceleration
----------------------------
Additional configuration is required on your development system platform. For Windows and Mac development systems start the Android SDK Manager and select Extras > Intel Hardware Accelerated Execution Manager:
Then run the IntelHAXM installation:

Windows: [sdk]/extras/intel/Hardware_Accelerated_Execution_Manager/IntelHAXM.exe
Mac: [sdk]/extras/intel/Hardware_Accelerated_Execution_Manager/IntelHAXM.dmg

Once install is complete you can verify the your configuration by executing the following command from a terminal window:

Windows: sc query intelhaxm
Mac: kextstat | grep intel

Please refer to  the Android guide > http://developer.android.com/tools/devices/emulator.html#accel-vm, to configure your environment for virtual machine acceleration.

----------------------------
Create an Android Emulator with Hardware Acceleration
----------------------------
Graphics acceleration for the emulator takes advantage of the graphics processing unit (GPU) of your computer for faster screen drawing.

* Open the Android Virtual Device (AVD) Manager from within Android Studio.
* Click the 'Create Virtual Device' button.
* Select a 'Category' and 'Device Template' and Click 'Next'.
* Choose a 'Release Name', must be Android 4.0.3 or higher, from the table and click 'Next'.
* Type in an 'Name' for your emulator in the text box next to 'AVD Name'.
* Ensure 'Use Host GPU' is checked and click 'Finish'
